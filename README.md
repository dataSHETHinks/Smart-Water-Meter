# Smart-Water-Meter
A smart water meter is a device that is used for measuring the water consumption by homeowners who
have the gadget installed within their establishment. To date, rollouts of smart meters are mostly induced
to obtain larger amount of data regarding end-use (such as use by the garden, toilet, shower, etc.) and
time of use as well as by the effectiveness of the mechanism to reduce labor costs for a meter reading. So,
in this paper, we propose a solution to this serious dilemma, i.e., water conservation, with the help of a
smart water metering system whose fundamental purpose is to monitor household water usage and
prevent wastage of water with the help of our low-cost IOT based system and various sensors to gather
information about water consumption and flow parameters. The purpose of this system is
considerable with all the parameters such as water conservation, effective water management, developing
technologies, etc. The core circuit of the project contains only sensors and the Raspberry Pi, which are of
no harm to the environment at all. It will greatly reduce the work of the officials in charge of maintaining
the public records manually, as it proved an ideal and trust-worthy solution of using the databases, filled
with the information provided by the sensors.
